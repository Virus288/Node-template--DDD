# OWASP Security Compliance Documentation

This document outlines how our application adheres to the OWASP Top Ten Security Risks. Each section covers a potential security vulnerability and the mitigation steps we have implemented.

## 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

### Risk:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

### Mitigation:

- Input Sanitization:
All user inputs are sanitized and escaped before being rendered on the frontend.

- Helmet.js:
We use the helmet package to set HTTP headers that help protect against XSS and other attacks.

## 2. Security Misconfiguration

### Risk:

Insecure default configurations or misconfigurations can expose the application to attacks.

### Mitigation:

- Use of Helmet.js:
helmet.js helps protect the app by setting secure HTTP headers.

- CORS Configuration:
We restrict CORS to trusted domains only, preventing unauthorized access to our APIs.

## 3. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities

### Risk:

Using libraries or packages with known vulnerabilities can expose the app to security risks.

### Mitigation:

- NPM Audit:
We regularly run npm audit to detect and resolve vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

## 4. Insufficient Logging & Monitoring

### Risk:

Without proper logging and monitoring, it's difficult to detect and respond to security breaches.

### Mitigation:

- Centralized Logging:
We use winston for structured logging, ensuring that all critical events are logged.

- Alerting System: 
We plan to integrate monitoring tools to provide real-time alerts on suspicious activity.

## 5. Insecure Deserialization

### Risk:
Insecure deserialization can allow attackers to manipulate serialized objects and execute arbitrary code.

### Mitigation:

-JSON Handling:
We ensure that all serialized data is validated and parsed safely before deserialization. In the context of Express.js, we carefully handle incoming JSON payloads to avoid deserialization attacks.
